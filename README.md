### [Iktomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iktomi)

> In Lakota mythology, Iktómi is a spider-trickster spirit, and a culture hero for the Lakota people. Alternate names for Iktómi include Ikto, Ictinike, Inktomi, Unktome, and Unktomi. These names are due to the differences in languages between different indigenous nations, as this spider deity was known throughout many of North America's tribes.

a reference to a shape-shifting spider spirit because of the web structure of the graph and the property of graphs being capable of taking on different appearances but remain the same graph (isomorphism).
